# Identification and visualisation of PPI interfaces using biopython and nglview

This material is part of the workshop "PDB structures: Processing and Visualisation" at the [ABACBS 2020 Virtual Conference](https://www.abacbs.org/conference2020).

The workshop is an introduction to protein structure data in the Protein Data Bank ([PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/)) and how to process it for data extraction. I presented a brief introduction to the Protein Data Bank and how protein structure data is organised. I focused on .pdb files and tools to process them. Here I covered [biopython](https://biopython.org) to parse protein structure data from the PDB and [nglviewer](http://nglviewer.org/) as an alternative for data visualisation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6

## Installation

Using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
jupyter notebook
```

All the examples are available in the notebook **biopython_nglviewer.ipynb**.
